OceanSim is a high-fidelity underwater simulation framework designed to accelerate the development of robust underwater perception solutions. Leveraging GPU-accelerated rendering and advanced physics-based techniques, OceanSim accurately models both visual and acoustic sensors, significantly reducing the simulation-to-real gap.

## Highlights
![OceanSim pitch](../media/pitch.png)
<!-- GPU-accelerated, physics-based underwater sensor rendering, highly effetcive 3D workflows, open-source -->
<!-- use emoji -->
🚀 **GPU-accelerated**: OceanSim fully leverages the power of GPU-based parallel computing. OceanSim is built on top of [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim) and is part of [NVIDIA Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) ecosystem, which provide high performance and real-time rendering. \
🌊 **Physics-based underwater sensor rendering**: Experience realistic simulations with advanced physics models that accurately replicate underwater sensor data under varied conditions. \
🎨 **Efficient 3D workflows**: Users of OceanSim can enjoy efficient 3D workflows empowered by [OpenUSD](https://openusd.org/release/index.html). \
🤝 **Built by the community, for the community**: OceanSim is an open-source project and we invite the community to join us to keep improving it!
