# ocean_frontier_exploration
ROS 2–based frontier exploration framework for underwater robots in OceanSim (Isaac Sim). The repository provides mapping, frontier detection, and control pipelines that interface with Isaac Sim via ROS 2 topics, enabling autonomous exploration using acoustic and visual sensing in simulated underwater environments.
