  ros__parameters:
    # Detection rate
    detection_rate: 1.0           # Hz - how often to detect frontiers

    # Frontier filtering
    min_frontier_size: 2.0        # FIXED: lowered to allow smaller frontiers (was 5.0, too restrictive)

    # Clustering
    cluster_radius: 1.5           # FIXED: larger clusters for stability (was 1.0)

    # Information gain
    information_radius: 2.0       # Meters - cube size for counting unknown voxels

    # Best frontier selection
    lambda_distance: 0.3          # FIXED: prefer closer frontiers more (was 0.1)

    # Coordinate frames
    map_frame: "UW_camera_world"  # Map frame
    robot_frame: "UW_camera"      # Robot frame (FIXED: was base_link)

    # Multi-resolution
    refinement_depth: 14          # Octree depth for frontier detection
                                  # Lower = coarser/faster, Higher = finer/slower
